# Stock Indy 500


# Proposal

The stock market has been more or less restructured as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Certain industries were hit harder, some recovered faster, and some are still in recovery mode.

We propose a time series analysis that looks at different industries and compares their daily price change, day over day, YTD, with other assets such as the Dollar, Gold and Bitcoin.

This will allow us to visualize the impact COVID-19 really had across industries as well as the other asset classes.


# Technology to Use

We will primarily be using stock APIs such as [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/docs/data-reference/factset_fundamentals#factset-fundamentals-data-reference) and [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/data).
