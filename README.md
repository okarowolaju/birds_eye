# Stock Indy 500


## Background

The 2020 virus pandemic, known as COVID-19, took the world, and the stock market, for a spin, to say the least. The stock market has been more or less restructured as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Certain industries were hit harder, some recovered faster, and some are still in recovery mode.


## Proposal

We propose a time series analysis that looks at different industries and compares their daily price change, day over day, YTD, with other assets such as the Dollar, Gold and Bitcoin.

This will allow us to visualize the impact COVID-19 really had across industries as well as the other asset classes.


## Type of Data

Beginning in January 2020, we will look into: 

    SPY 500 ETF:
        SPY
        
    Gold ETF:
        XAU
        
    Dollar Index:
        DXY
        
    Bitcoin:
        BTC


## Questions asked of Data

How did specific industries perform in comparison to the market as a whole?
How did the market as a whole compare to other benchmark asset classes, such as the Dollar, Bitcoin, and Gold?
